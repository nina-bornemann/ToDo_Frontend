# 🧩 ToDo App — Frontend Implementation

![img.png](./frontend/img.png)

This project is a simple but complete **ToDo management app** 
built with **React + TypeScript** on the frontend and a **Spring 
Boot REST API** on the backend.
In my [previous project](https://github.com/nina-bornemann/ToDo_Backend_Project), the **frontend** was provided and I 
built the **backend**.  
This time, the challenge was reversed - the **backend** was 
given, and I implemented the **frontend** from scratch.

The goal: to create a fully functional, clean, and responsive user interface that interacts with the existing REST API.

This is a work in progress (see Future Implementations ⬇️)



---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch all ToDos from the backend and display them by status:
    - 🟢 **To Do**
    - 🟡 **In Progress**
    - 🔵 **Done**
- Create new ToDos
- Edit descriptions inline
- Change ToDo status via dropdown (and auto-move between columns)
- Real-time updates without page reloads
- Error handling for failed requests

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React (with hooks)
- TypeScript
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- CSS / basic styling

**Backend (given):**
- Java Spring Boot
- REST API (with endpoints for GET, POST, PUT)

---

## 📸 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/todo` | Fetch all ToDos |
| `POST` | `/api/todo` | Create a new ToDo |
| `PUT` | `/api/todo/{id}` | Update existing ToDo (description/status) |

**Example ToDo object:**
```json
{
  "id": "a12b3c",
  "description": "Finish React project",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
}     
```

- Add toast notifications for success/error
- Unit tests for components
- Drag-and-drop ToDo rearranging
